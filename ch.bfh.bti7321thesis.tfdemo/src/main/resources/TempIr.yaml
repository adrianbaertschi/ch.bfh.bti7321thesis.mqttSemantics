id: "IoT - Temperature IR Bricklet"
version: "0.0.1"
description: |
  The Temperature IR Bricklet is equipped with a infrared thermometer. 
  It can extend the features of a Brick with the capability of contactless temperature measurement.
  You can read out object temperature and ambient temperature in Â°C. 
  It is possible to define the emissivity of the object you want to measure (most infrared thermometers can't do this) . 
  With configurable events it is possible to react on changing temperatures without polling.
